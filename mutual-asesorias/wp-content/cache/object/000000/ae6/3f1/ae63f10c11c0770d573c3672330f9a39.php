Launched in 2009 as a plugin called Site Monitor, the service has evolved over time to allow users to upgrade themes, plugins, and WordPress remotely. The service allows an unlimited amount of sites to be tracked for free.</p>
<p>Human Made is not able to devote the time and resources necessary to maintain the service, even as it continues to do well. According to Tim Willmot, Co-founder and CEO of Human Made, the team backed out of the <a href="https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/">premium version</a> of the service due to a lack of resources:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had <a href="https://wpremote.com/blog/">ambitious plans for a version 2</a>, we <a href="https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/">introduced a premium version</a> that we backed out of because we didnâ€™t have the resources to run and grow it, and weâ€™ve got lots of great ideas both from its users and ourselves that we havenâ€™t been able to act on. Weâ€™re too busy with other things, including Happytables, our client work, events, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>WP Remote has over 18K users with more than 96K sites monitored. Here are some other notable statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,850 people logged in during the past 30 days.</li>
<li>1,200 of those have more than five sites added to their account and 110 of them have more than 50 sites monitored.</li>
<li>In the past 30 days WP Remote was used to perform over 20,000 plugin updates.</li>
<li>Each week between 50 and 100 new users sign up and over half of them go on to add a site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although WP Remote converted 60 free users to its premium service, the company eliminated it due to the lack of internal resources to support, develop, and market it. WP Remote also has key relationships with web hosting companies such as, Pressable, BlueHost, and SiteGround.</p>
<p>Before inquiring about purchasing the service, I recommend that you <a href="https://wpremote.com/2013/08/08/the-story-of-wp-remote/">read the history</a> on how it was created. If you&#8217;re interested in acquiring WP Remote or have questions, contact Tom atÂ  <a href="mailto:tom@hmn.md">tom@hmn.md</a>. The company plans to decide who the buyer is by the end of February 2016 and is in early discussions with a few interested parties.</p>

The site launched earlier this year and has more than 170 plugins listed in the directory. Gliebe doesn&#8217;t have the time to manage the project anymore and is looking to give it to someone who is capable of maximizing the site&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>Since May of this year, commercial plugin developers have slowly added their products to the directory. Gliebe explains his original strategy for monetizing the site, &#8220;Build the directory up (get authors to list their plugins) in order to attract traffic (plugin buyers) then monetize it with display ads, affiliate links and/or sponsorships (not yet started).&#8221;</p>
<p>Gliebe spends 1-2 hours per week managing the directory which includes, moderating submissions, moderating comments, moderating reviews, answering emails, and responding to tweets. He suggests that the new owner will need to spend more time marketing in order for the project to keep growing.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting parts of the sale offer is where Gliebe explains what powers the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site is powered by Easy Digital Downloads, the <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/frontend-submissions/" target="_blank">Frontend Submissions</a> extension, the <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/product-reviews/" target="_blank">Product Reviews</a> extension and Arrayâ€™s <a href="https://arraythemes.com/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">Checkout</a> theme (using a child theme for customizations like showing categories on the homepage).</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at the analytics, the site is experiencing low traffic numbers compared to when the site was launched. However, organic search traffic is steadily rising thanks to the content published on the <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/blog/">site&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ProPluginTrafficStats.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48925"><img class="size-full wp-image-48925" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ProPluginTrafficStats.png?resize=814%2C1216" alt="Pro Plugin Directory Traffic" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Traffic
<p>Outside of Codecanyon, Pro Plugin Directory is one of the only other directories exclusively catered to commercial plugins. Here&#8217;s what Gliebe will give the buyer after purchasing the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The buyer will receive the domain,Â website files, database dump, mailing lists and Twitter account. Easy Digital Downloads add-on licenses and Checkout theme licensesÂ will be transferred.Â You will need to purchase a new SSL certificate.Â I am looking for a capable buyer but if you require migration assistance or technical support after the sale, I will offer my servicesÂ at $200/hour (five hours max).</p></blockquote>
<p>Escrow will be used to facilitate the sale between both parties. If you&#8217;re interested in taking over the site or have questions, <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/contact/">contact Steven Gliebe.</a></p>

He also tells the story of his first ever WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS). Then, he interviews Mike McAlister, of Array Themes, and they talk about the process of building a commercial WordPress theme from the ground up.</p>
<p>The interview with Mike starts around 14 minutes in.</p>

<p>I saw the new Steve Jobs movie a few days ago, which I enjoyed as a movie even though <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/10/22/mossberg-steve-jobs">the main elements were fiction and it should have been titled something else</a>.</p>
<p>But they had an awesome video interview withÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke">the amazing Arthur C. Clarke</a> in 1974, which I&#8217;ve embedded above, where he said the following right around 0:56.</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewer: I wonder though, what sort of a life will it be in social terms if our whole life is built around the computer, if we become a computer-dependent society, computer-dependent individuals.</p>
<p>ACC: In some ways, but they&#8217;ll also enrich our society because it&#8217;ll make it possible for us to live anywhere we like. Any businessman, any executive could live almost anywhere on earth and still do his business through a device like this, and this is a wonderful thing, it means we won&#8217;t have to be stuck in cities, we can live out in the country or wherever we please, and still carry on complete interaction with human beings, as well as with other computers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow, extremely prescient. Remember, this was 1974! The dominant technology companies of today still follow the same office-centric model as when computers took up entire rooms, but the dominant companies of tomorrow will be built and grow in a completely distributed fashion. (And of course, <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/">we&#8217;re hiring</a>.)</p>

There&#8217;s still <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/">251 tickets available</a> to attend the event in person. The <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/">schedule and sessions</a> are published and it looks like an informational packed two-day event.</p>
<p>There are three tracks available, two of which will have typical length sessions with a third track dedicated to lightning talks. I highly encourage you to <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/">view the schedule</a> and create a list of sessions to attend as the first day has over 40 of them.</p>
<p>Reed Gustow, one of the event&#8217;s primary organizers says they&#8217;re expecting a lot of attendees, &#8220;We&#8217;re expecting 2,000 attendees from across the United States and from many other countries, and it will be a wonderful opportunity to learn, share knowledge and meet others in the amazing WordPress community.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to WordCamp US, there will be a <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/11/09/join-us-for-the-wordcamp-us-contributor-day/">WordPress contributor day</a> on December 6th. During contributor day, people from all walks of life get together and contribute to various parts of the WordPress project whether it&#8217;s the support forums, core code, documentation, and more. Mentors will be on hand to help new contributors.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the most important information is where to eat a great tasting cheesesteak. After all, it&#8217;s one of the things <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/itineraries/philadelphia/where-to-find-the-best-cheesesteaks-in-philadelphia/">Philadelphia is known for</a>. The WordCamp US organizing team has you <a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/11/09/the-cheesesteak-post/">covered with a post</a> that describes the different types of cheesesteaks and where to find the best tasting ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/location/">Hotel and venue information</a> for the event is on the WordCamp US website. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not attending the event this year, but <a href="http://wptavern.com/contributors">Sarah Gooding</a> will be there. If you see her, stop her and say hi.</p>

<p>The following image shows WordPress&#8217; rapid growth from 13.1% in January 2011 to 25% today.</p>

<p>Drupal and Joomla, two other popular open source content management systems combine for 4.9%, slightly less than 1/5th of WordPress.</p>
<p>W3Techs counts both self hosted WordPress and WordPress.com sites, &#8220;We only count the hosted sites if they are reachable via their own domain (not only as subdomain of wordpress.com), and they must qualify like all other sites in our surveys by getting enough visitors on that separate domain to make it into the top 10 million Alexa sites,&#8221; Gelbmann says.</p>
<p>This means that only those sites on WordPress.com that use domain mapping and have enough traffic to be in the top 10 million Alexa sites are counted leaving millions of WordPress.com sites uncounted. Only 1.25% of WordPress sites in the survey are hosted at WordPress.com.</p>
<h2>The Fastest Growing CMS</h2>
<p>The survey also shows that WordPress is still the fastest growing CMS, &#8220;Every 74 seconds a site within the top 10 million starts using WordPress. Compare this with Shopify, the second-fastest growing CMS, which is gaining a new site every 22 minutes,&#8221; Gelbmann says.</p>
<p>When sites are broken down into languages, WordPress is used on 37.3% of English language sites. Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish sites are inbetween 38-40% while Bengali is 51.3% and 54.4% for Bosnian. Only 10.6% of WordPress sites are in Chinese with 6.9% for Korean.</p>
<p>About 94% of sites surveyed use a Unix-like operating system such as Ubuntu. Windows servers host 6.2% of WordPress sites making it the most popular CMS running on Windows servers.</p>
<p>Matt Mullenweg, Co-founder of the WordPress project, says the <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/">largest opportunity for growth</a> is in the 57% of sites not using <em>any</em> identifiable CMS. Earlier this year, we learned that <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share">Jetpack is going to play a significant role</a> in WordPress gaining 50% or more of market share.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e048-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/" target="_blank">interview with Adam Silver on the KitchensinkWP podcast</a>, Mullenweg explains the path to 50% and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p>The next goal is the majority of websites. We want to get to 50%+ and thereâ€™s a lot of work between now and then. As the percentage increases, it gets harder and harder to grow the market share, and we have to grow the market share by doing things we havenâ€™t done in the past â€“ really thinking about the onboarding process, really thinking about the integration with social networks, and with how WordPress works on touch devices, which is going to be the predominant computing platform of the future. These things are going to be really important.</p>
<p>What got us here isnâ€™t going to get us there. Once we get to 50%, we can decide something new we want to do</p></blockquote>
<p>Automattic is experimenting with a new side project called <a href="https://github.com/automattic/jetpack-onboarding">Jetpack Onboarding</a>. The project is an attempt to improve WordPress&#8217; new user experience. Hosting companies that choose to implement it can modify, add, or remove steps.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that W3Techs&#8217; market share numbers are based on the top 10 million sites in Alexa. Fifty percent market share is 5 million of those 10 million sites. Are these the sites WordPress should be targeting with development efforts? Are they more important than the millions of sites not ranked by Alexa? I don&#8217;t think so but only time will tell.</p>

<p>The big opportunity is still the 57% of websites that don&#8217;t use <em>any</em> identifiable CMS yet, and that&#8217;s where I think there is still a ton of growth for us (and I&#8217;m also rooting for all the other open source CMSes).</p>

Communicating online is hard but where and how you communicate affects the likelihood of making an impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmscritic.com/">CMS Critic</a> is a site I&#8217;ve read for years as it routinely publishes articles on a variety of content management systems, including WordPress.</p>
<p>In late October, Kaya Ismail <a href="http://www.cmscritic.com/how-wordpress-needs-to-improve-itself/">published an article</a> that describes how WordPress needs to improve itself in six ways. What could have been a great article, is instead a great example of <strong>how not to</strong> communicate grievances you have with WordPress.</p>
<h2>Twenty Sixteen Developers Are Lazy</h2>
<p>Many people, including myself <a href="http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme#comments">have an opinion</a> of the Twenty Sixteen theme in WordPress 4.4. Ismail thinks the developers behind the theme are lazy.</p>
<blockquote><p>I totally understand that WordPress doesn&#8217;t need to compete with the massive library of third-party themes available out there, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they should lead with a default theme as bad as that. It&#8217;s nothing short of lazy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tammie Lister, Takashi Irie, and others continue to work hard on Twenty Sixteen to prepare it for the WordPress 4.4 release in December. They are far from lazy people making Ismail&#8217;s opinion more of an insult. He doesn&#8217;t provide any examples or ideas on what should be in a default theme.</p>
<h2>The WordPress Plugin Directory</h2>
<p>According to Ismail, the WordPress plugin directory is filled with large chunks of trash in addition to great plugins. While some plugins in the directory could be coded better, his explanation falls short of describing a solution.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many plugins simply don&#8217;t work, while many more are poorly put together, which in turn makes WordPress as a platform harder to use. Quality control needs to improve.</p></blockquote>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t link to plugins that are broken, provide any code samples, or show where quality control is lacking. His statement is an assumption that&#8217;s not backed by evidence.</p>
<p>Those who <a href="http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein">oversee the plugin directory</a> don&#8217;t test every submitted plugin to make sure it works with WordPress. Among other things, their job is to make sure plugin submissions don&#8217;t have security issues. If the moderators performed quality control on every plugin, the submission queue would likely have a substantial backlog.</p>
<p>Instead of writing baseless assumptions, Ismail should monitor the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/">Make WordPress Plugins</a> site to stay on top of what&#8217;s going on with the plugin directory and submit feedback where necessary. If a broken plugin is discovered, he should create a forum thread within the plugin&#8217;s support area.</p>
<p>This way, his feedback is seen by those who directly control the WordPress plugin directory. The simple act of reporting a broken plugin to the developer is a major step towards being part of the solution and not the problem.</p>
<h2>Admin Menu Clutter</h2>
<p>I agree with Ismail&#8217;s opinion that the WordPress admin menus can become cluttered if the right plugins are activated. At least in this case, he suggests an alternative.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like to see WordPress group third-party menu options together, in a way that&#8217;s a little more organized and less intrusive. Perhaps this can be done by giving them a sub-section within the menu which can be collapsed. The solution itself is up to them, but the problem is evident.</p></blockquote>
<p>There <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Menus">are guidelines</a> for when plugin developers should create top-level or sub-level menu items but they&#8217;re not followed as well as they could be. Without strictly enforcing these guidelines, it&#8217;s out of WordPress&#8217; hands. The complaint is aimed in the wrong direction and should point towards third-party developers, not WordPress itself.</p>
<p>If you want more control in how items are displayed in the admin menu, I recommend using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-humility/">Menu Humility</a> plugin by Mark Jaquith.</p>
<h2>Akismet is Not Enough</h2>
<p>According to Ismail, comment spam is a major issue with WordPress sites and Akismet doesn&#8217;t do enough to stop it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Akismet, a spam comment filter, now comes with every WordPress install &#8211; which is a good thing. But the free version doesn&#8217;t do enough for me, as comments still pile up in the back end. If you ask me, WordPress needs to find another way to turn the unrelenting tide of spam.</p></blockquote>
<p>To clarify, Akismet has been bundled with WordPress since <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2005/12/wp2/">version 2.0</a> and there&#8217;s no difference between the free and commercial versions in how Akismet protects sites. He doesn&#8217;t provide any suggestions on what WordPress could do to thwart spam but says it has to do something.</p>
<p>What are members of the WordPress core team supposed to do with this kind of feedback? It&#8217;s not helpful, doesn&#8217;t provide any ideas, and is easy to discard.</p>
<h2>Updates are Hard</h2>
<p>Depending on your webhost&#8217;s configuration, updating themes, plugins, and WordPress is as simple as clicking a button. For the more adventurous, you can configure them to happen automatically. For Ismail, the update process is difficult.</p>
<blockquote><p>Updating a plugin may cause conflicts between it and another plugin. Updating a theme can erase your modifications (unless you use a child theme), whereas updating WordPress itself can render a variety of your plugins redundant until their developers apply a patch. Confused yet? You should be.</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes a few good points but editing a theme instead of a child theme is like editing WordPress core files which should almost never happen. It&#8217;s true that there is a slight risk of <a href="http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites">things breaking</a> after an update but it&#8217;s more of an anomaly than a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Ismail suggests that WordPress look into preserving theme changes across the board and to provide alerts ifÂ  plugins interfere with each other. I like these suggestions and my hope is that one day, WordPress will be able to create a snapshot during the update process to provide assurance that the site won&#8217;t break after an update is applied.</p>
<h2>WordPress Hack-a-thon</h2>
<p>Ismail&#8217;s last point is how WordPress can improve its security.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think we can all agree that WordPress needs to beef itself up (by shoring up its admin login page, for example), but I call for it to go a step further and start offering better protection, even if it comes at a small price.</p>
<p>Third party solutions exist, sure. But why should I have to patch together several security plugins, each with their own confusing settings, just to secure my website? Many WordPress users have become accustom to handling their own security in this way; but I think WordPress needs to take on more responsibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>He wants WordPress to go a step further and offer better protection but doesn&#8217;t say what that protection is. He also doesn&#8217;t explain where, how, or why WordPress should take on more responsibility to make sites more secure.</p>
<h2>Be Part of the Solution, Not the Problem</h2>
<p>Ismail concludes his article by saying it&#8217;s time for WordPress to innovate. He also says, &#8220;The onus isn&#8217;t on me to provide the solution, it&#8217;s upon WordPress. And it&#8217;s about time they started coming up with innovative solutions for their long-standing issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article is <a href="https://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-4.4-beta-bare-bones/">another example</a> of how CMS Critic chooses not to be part of the solution. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but airing grievances which sound more like demands and telling core developers to start innovating is not a recipe for results.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/contributing-to-wordpress/">This quote</a> from WordPress core developer, Mark Jaquith, eloquently describes how important communication skills are in an open source project.</p>
<blockquote><p>The number one skill you need for just about any job, but specifically working on open source, is communication skills. You need to have clarity, consistency, compassion, relatability, a little bit of a thick skin and a decent sense of humor.</p></blockquote>
<p>The onus may not be on Ismail or any of us to come up with solutions, but he and others can help discover and be part of solutions by taking an active role in giving constructive feedback in <a href="http://hughlashbrooke.com/2015/11/03/a-non-developers-guide-to-getting-involved-in-wordpress-core-development/">the right place</a>. WordPress has its fair share of issues but there are <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/contributing-to-wordpress/">plenty of opportunities</a> for people to step up and contribute to make the software better.</p>

<p>Users can now display a Google+ Badge widget that shows your Google+ profile, page, or community.</p>

<p>You can configure the badge&#8217;s width, layout, and choose between a light or dark color scheme. A Google+ icon has also been added to the Social Media Icons widget bringing the total number of available icons to nine.</p>
<p>Those who use the Shortcode Embeds module can now easily embed videos from <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a> using the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/videos/twitch-tv-shortcode/">[ twitchtv ] shortcode</a>. The shortcode&#8217;s attributes allow you to modify the width, height, and whether or not the video autoplays.</p>
<p>In previous versions of Jetpack, the Contact Form module checkbox field type was limited to a single item. In Jetpack 3.8, check box field types can have multiple items.</p>

<p>One of my favorite enhancements in Jetpack 3.8 is the improved styling to contact form email responses. In previous versions of Jetpack, emails <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/49">didn&#8217;t match the order of the fields</a> within the contact form. Now, any responses to the contact form will show up in the order you set.</p>
<p>Other notable improvements in Jetpack 3.8 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of new filters to allow further customization of Jetpack.</li>
<li>Better error messaging for Subscription Widget sign up forms.</li>
<li>Improvements and enhancements to accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to features and bug fixes, this release contains contributions from Daisuke Takahashi and Eduardo Reveles. Takahashi lives in Japan and is responsible for the Google+ Badge Widget. Reveles not only filed a <a href="https://github.com/osiux">substantial amount of issue reports on Github</a> but also submitted a lot of patches.</p>
<p>These two are among a group of more than 40 people who worked on Jetpack 3.8. Check out Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="http://jetpack.me/contribute/">contribute page</a> if you&#8217;d like to get involved with the project.

Six years <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10142">in the making</a>, taxonomy term meta <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/">will be available</a> in WordPress 4.4.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me and don&#8217;t have a clue as to what taxonomy term meta is, I highly encourage you to read Justin Tadlock&#8217;s <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/introduction-to-wordpress-term-meta">explanation and tutorial</a>. In the post, Tadlock explains why term meta is significant and some of the possibilities it affords developers.</p>
<p>After reading through the tutorial, I have a better understanding as to why developers are so excited. Not only does it create more opportunities to extend WordPress, but does so in a standard and expected way. Previous to WordPress 4.4, developers had to rely on work-arounds to add term meta to taxonomies.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the tutorial and how you plan to take advantage of this feature once WordPress 4.4 is released.</p>

<p>Citations are inserted into the post with HTML5 markup. The blockquote button retains its default behaviour with highlighted text. I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.4 beta 3 and it works as advertised.</p>
<p>I did notice however, that the citation displays immediately after the last character in the quote. I&#8217;d prefer to have</p>
<p>a space between the last character and the citation.</p>

The guide explains how and where to provide feedback and how important it is to beta test new features.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve used WP Tavern to advocate for and against features in WordPress. One of the best pieces of advice I can give non-developers is to organize your thoughts or stance on a specific feature or direction and publish them on your site. This allows you to control the conversation and gives you plenty of space to explain your perspective.</p>
<p>A great example <a href="http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress">is this post</a> asking for help to add comment moderation approval notifications to WordPress. I explain why it&#8217;s needed with a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717">link to the ticket</a> I created to keep track of the conversation. I prefer to write about potential features and based on feedback, I&#8217;ll either create a trac ticket myself or someone will do it for me with a link to the post.</p>
<p>The Tavern is in the dashboard and is read by a large audience, including core developers. However, thanks to social media, a well constructed post with solid points will make the rounds on Twitter, Facebook, and within WordPress sub-communities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s those posts and associated comments that serve as one of many foundations for change in WordPress without touching a line of code. Keep in mind that there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll be able to directly influence WordPress core development with words alone, but respectful, in-depth conversations with differing opinions and perspectives are an important part of the community regardless.</p>

He created the campaign to generate funding to develop a CLI interface for the WordPress REST API.</p>
<p>According to Bachhuber, the project will allow WordPress REST API endpoints registered via plugins and themes to automatically be usable as WP-CLI commands. Developers will also be able to push and pull posts including, custom post types, users, and other WordPress REST API data between separate WordPress installations with a simple WP-CLI command.</p>
<p>Bachhuber requested $17.5K and within twelve hours of publishing the campaign, he received more than the asking amount from 51 backers, including one who contributed $8,500. Bachhuber will donate one hour of time to the WordPress REST API project in 2016 for every $100 over the funding goal. Based on the current amount, that&#8217;s 46 hours.</p>
<p>With funding in place, Bachhuber will work on the project throughout the first half of 2016, &#8220;$17,500 represents 150 hours of development at $100/hour, plus Kickstarter&#8217;s cut and costs associated with the rewards. I intend to use this time over the first six months of 2016,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still 28 days left in the campaign and if it reaches $40K, he pledges to help figure out how the REST API will handle <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/1055">password protected posts</a>.</p>

The page features a timeline where visitors can browse every major version of WordPress released since 1.0. Versions are displayed in a horizontal timeline format with fancy animations when hovered over.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordPresstimeMachine.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48815"><img class="size-full wp-image-48815" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordPresstimeMachine.png?resize=1025%2C554" alt="WordPress Time Machine" /></a>WordPress Time Machine
<p>Unfortunately, the animations are more distracting than they are useful and add a small delay when viewing images. The full-size images are not large enough and appear blurry when clicked on. If 93Digital removes the animations and uses larger images, the timeline would be a nice way to visually browse through WordPress&#8217; history.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to see clear, large images of past WordPress releases and learn about some of the key features in each version, I recommend reading <a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/wordpress-through-the-ages">WordPress through the ages</a>. Through the images, you can see the natural progression of features, designs, and layouts WordPress has gone through during the past 10 years.</p>

In WordPress 4.4, it switches roles and is an oEmbed provider.</p>
<p>Proposed by Pascal Birchler <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">earlier this year</a>, oEmbeds for posts streamlines how they&#8217;re shared across the web. Here&#8217;s an example of what an oEmbedded post looks like.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Content is displayed in an iFrame with a link to comments, a sharing button, and a link to the main page the article is hosted on. The continue reading link takes visitors to the source site. In the last three months, Birchler and members of the core team have worked hard to make sure embedded content is secure.</p>
<ul>
<li>The iFrames use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Attributes">sandbox attribute</a> to enable extra restrictions on content that can appear in the inline frame.</li>
<li>The host and the embedded site communicate via postMessage to allow resizing and clicking on links safely</li>
</ul>
<p>oEmbed discovery is turned on by default in WordPress 4.4. Too disable it, you&#8217;ll need install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-embeds/">Disable Embeds</a> plugin. The plugin does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents others from embedding your site.</li>
<li>Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.</li>
<li>Disables all JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/#comment-28263">are requesting</a> that an option be added to disable oEmbeds rather than installing a plugin. In response to requests, Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, reemphasized <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#decisions">WordPress&#8217; philosophy</a> on adding options.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every time you give a user an option, you are asking them to make a decision. When a user doesnâ€™t care or understand the option this ultimately leads to frustration. As developers we sometimes feel that providing options for everything is a good thing, you can never have too many choices, right?</p>
<p>Ultimately these choices end up being technical ones, choices that the average end-user has no interest in. Itâ€™s our duty as developers to make smart design decisions and avoid putting the weight of technical choices on our end users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Birchler also responded saying, &#8220;The new embed functionality was developed with the majority of users in mind.&#8221; One of the largest problems with adding to options to WordPress is that they&#8217;re difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Some WordPress developers are excited to see how post embeds can be extended. <a href="http://hughlashbrooke.com/">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who works for Automattic, thinks post embeds will be great for Custom Post Types, &#8220;I think the oEmbed feature has loads of awesome use cases for Custom Post Types. For example, being able to embed eCommerce products on other sites with dynamic add to cart links,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The easiest way to try post embeds is to log into <a href="http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta">TryWPBeta</a> using these credentials.</p>

Joe McGill, who is helping to merge the feature to core, joined me for a thirty minute interview to explain how it works.</p>
<p>When users upload images in WordPress, it automatically crops new images to smaller sizes. For example, if you upload an image that&#8217;s 1500 x 706, the image sizes might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Size &#8211; 1500 x 706</li>
<li>Large &#8211; 500 x 235</li>
<li>Medium &#8211; 300 x 141</li>
<li>Thumbnail &#8211; 150 x 150</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional sizes are created depending on the theme. If the full size image is attached to a post, users on desktop and mobile devices will see the full size image. However, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to use the full size image on mobile devices because of its display and file size.</p>
<p>Responsive images in WordPress 4.4 adds <code>srcset</code>&nbsp;and <code>sizes</code> support to WordPress. This allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device&#8217;s screen size. If I attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress 4.4, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead.</p>
<p>Responsive images don&#8217;t have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes. I encourage you to listen to the interview as it may be easier to understand listening to us talk through the feature.</p>

While the criteria to reach the page is not publicly known, download counts are one form of measurement.</p>
<p>Since September, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/swift/">Swift theme</a> has routinely shown up on the popular themes page. According to download stats, Swift was downloaded between, 2,000 to 3,500 times a day in September and early October.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48767" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png?resize=665%2C500" alt="Swift Download Count" /></a>Swift Download Count
<p>However, the stats drop off abruptly on October 15th and have yet to reach previous levels. On October 18th, a few members inside the Theme Review Team Slack channel <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445155458000095">shared suspicions</a> that something was not right with Swift&#8217;s download stats.</p>
<p>Ionut Neagu discovered that Swift does not appear on the <a href="https://garage.godaddy.com/top-100-wordpress-themes/">GoDaddy Hot 100</a> while other themes on the popular page do. While not conclusive, the evidence points towards some sort of anomaly.</p>
<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, who helps maintain WordPress.org <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445180169000105">looked at the raw</a> data for Swift and discovered that a lot of the downloads appeared to be automated.</p>
<blockquote><p>The swift theme is indeed getting an exceptional number of downloads, so I took a closer look at the raw data. It appears that a lot of these downloads are automated in some way. However, there&#8217;s no evidence that it is malicious, nor does the pattern apply only to the swift theme. Perhaps it is included in some installer system that auto-downloads themes for newly installed sites. It&#8217;s hard to say.</p>
<p>In any case, I made a way to detect and block these types of automated downloads from appearing in the stats, and retroactively applied it for the last three days of data (which is all we retain). Going forward, automated downloads will not appear as downloads and will not affect the popular listings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once the changes were implemented, Swift&#8217;s download stats significantly decreased. The changes also apply to all other themes hosted on the directory. Otto declined to comment on the specific changes made but tells the Tavern, &#8220;If we can detect a case where downloads aren&#8217;t being made by users, then we will try not to count it in the results.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Swiftâ€™s Side of the Story</h2>
<p>Satish Gandham, founder of <a href="https://swiftthemes.com/">Swiftthemes</a>, explains what Swift has gone through the last few weeks which may account for the high download numbers, &#8220;Swift was featured for a couple of days and we spent money on Facebook ads to promote the free version. Also, there were a couple of hosted WordPress providers who asked permission to include Swift on their platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The premium version of Swift also had the same slug URL as the free version. The WordPress theme directory saw v7.2.48 to be higher than 7.2.6 and premium users downgraded to the free version thinking it was an upgrade. It was a support nightmare,&#8221; Gandham tells the Tavern.</p>
<p>Swift&#8217;s <a href="https://swiftthemes.com/forums/topic/how-to-returning-to-version-7-2-6/">support forums</a> confirm that some customers of the commercial version were automatically updated to the free version in early August.</p>
<h2>Download Counts are Almost Irrelevant</h2>
<p>When the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design">plugin directory was redesigned</a> earlier this year, download counts were removed in favor of active installs. Active installs are more accurate and difficult to manipulate. On the other hand, when the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design">theme directory was redesigned</a>, download counts remained.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the theme directory will one day show active installs but the data gathering aspect is not ready yet. Also, the numbers are lower for themes than for plugins, which may lead to incorrect conclusions in regards to relative popularity.</p>
<h2>It Happens More Than You Might Think</h2>
<p>In this particular instance, there&#8217;s no evidence that points to a malicious intent to inflate stats to manipulate the popular themes page. In the years I&#8217;ve written about WordPress, I&#8217;ve heard rumors that certain plugins and themes automate their download counts to appear more popular than they really are. However, I&#8217;ve yet to write about a theme or plugin caught in the act.</p>
<p>According to Otto, it happens more often than you might think. When he or other volunteer moderators for the plugin and theme directories notice fishy download counts, they contact the author and the process usually stops. If it continues, the author risks having their themes and plugins suspended or banned from the directory.</p>
<p>If you notice suspicious activity with a theme hosted on WordPress.org, you can voice your concern in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Theme Review Slack</a> channel during non-meeting times. For suspicious activity related to plugins hosted on the directory, email <strong>plugins at WordPress.org</strong>.</p>

That&#8217;s because the <a href="https://managewp.com/developer-diary-9-managewp-orion-is-out">company released Orion</a>, a completely redesigned dashboard for managing sites.</p>
<p>To give users a chance to alter workflows and explore the Orion dashboard, ManageWP linked the original dashboard to Orion. Actions performed in one dashboard are mirrored to the other. Users can switch between the two with the click of a button.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-48757" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif?resize=638%2C512" alt="ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion" /></a>ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion
<p>Users can now sort sites by tags and clients in addition to groups. Websites can be assigned to clients while tags can describe whether a site is in development or live. Each site can up to five tags and one client.</p>
<p>Unlike the native dashboard, Orion uses Angular.js which allows users to run asynchronous calls. For example, you can run more than one command why performing other tasks.</p>
<p>One distinct difference between both dashboards is the way backups are generated. ManageWP backups and Orion backups are <a href="https://managewp.com/managewp-orion-developer-diary-3-bulletproof-backup-solution">completely different</a> from each other. However, you can use both at the same time.</p>
<p>The company says Orion comes with essential features but additional features will be completed and added by February of 2016 which is also when Orion will become the default dashboard. WordPress Multisite is not supported as the company cites it as a major undertaking and doesn&#8217;t consider it a high priority.</p>
<p>The new dashboard contains more features than what&#8217;s listed here. I encourage you to read the <a href="https://managewp.com/developer-diary-9-managewp-orion-is-out">official announcement</a> and if you&#8217;re a customer, to explore Orion as it will soon be the default experience to managing sites. If you&#8217;re a ManageWP customer, let us know what you think of the new dashboard design.</p>

<p>This is a guest post contributed by <a href="https://mpswp.wordpress.com/">Matthew Sparrow</a> who is a young, self-taught developer with minimal coding knowledge that loves to use WordPress. He mostly uses WordPress for personal projects although he has completed a couple of projects for others. In addition to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kidsguide/">maintaining a few plugins</a>, he&#8217;s an active translations contributor.</p>
<hr />
<p>Automatic translations for plugins have been a long time coming. WordPress itself already auto-downloads and auto-updates core translations, so it is a natural progression that plugins and themes will receive the same treatment.</p>
<p>For those who have been following auto plugin translations, it has <a href="http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/">been in the works for years</a>. It came as a welcome surprise in September when it was announced that plugins will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/09/01/plugin-translations-on-wordpress-org/">finally be able to have language packs</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a plugin in the WordPress.org directory, then this is important, welcome, and exciting news. However, as great as an initiative as language packs are for plugins, it <em>seems</em> simpler than it actually is.</p>
<p>If you are a plugin developer, you have to go through a few steps in order to get this to work for your plugins. So letâ€™s get started.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Should You Be Excited About Plugin Language Packs?</h2>
<p>As a plugin author, I&#8217;m really excited about the new translation system, and so should you. The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">Polyglots team</a> is making it so that you no longer have to include all of your <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files directly in your plugin. Instead, they will be hosted on WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48731" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png?resize=582%2C575" alt="screenshot-1" /></a>The ideal scenario is when a user selects their language (either through a new WordPress install or through <code>Settings &gt; General</code>), the language pack for your plugin will be automatically installed and kept updated.</p>
<p>This new system accomplishes a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin files are smaller. There&#8217;s no need to include translation files with your plugin.</li>
<li>Plugin authors no longer need to manage translations/translators.</li>
<li>End users are automatically able to see a plugin in their own language assuming a translation has already been created for their locale.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="font-headlines">How to Prepare for Plugin Language Packs</h2>
<p>Before we jump into translating plugins, you first need to prepare your plugin for it to work with the new translation setup.</p>
<p>In order for you to get your plugin prepared to be moved over to the new system, you need to change your text domain to exactly match your WordPress plugin slug. An important reminder is that even if you have changed your plugin&#8217;s name (as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast SEO</a> recently did), the slug does not change. For a more in-depth discussion and tutorial, please follow Otto&#8217;s great post on <a href="http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/">language pack prepwork</a>.</p>
<p>You are still welcome to include translation files in your plugin, even with language packs enabled. Translation files in your plugin take priority, and if those aren&#8217;t present, that&#8217;s where language packs come in.</p>
<p>When you are preparing your plugin for language packs, it is important to note that you should avoid removing translation files from your plugin. If you do so, and your plugin is selected for language packs, your existing translations will not be automatically moved over to the new system.</p>
<p>Do your best to keep your translation files with your plugin until the Polyglots team has informed you that your plugin is ready for language packs.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Wait to Receive the Official Notice</h2>
<p>The Polyglot team is preparing the plugins in stages to avoid any major hiccups. Assuming your WordPress.org email is up-to-date, you will receive an email when your plugin is ready.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how long it takes before the team reaches your plugin. There are 40,000+ plugins on WordPress.org, so it is not a quick process. WordPress is preparing plugins in batches according to the amount of active installs each plugin has.</p>
<p>If your plugin has over 30,000+ active installs, then chances are you are on the new system, although I&#8217;ve seen plugins with 10,000+ active installs also be approved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to make the process quicker. Please practice patience and eventually your turn will come.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Youâ€™ve Received the E-Mail That Your Plugin Is Ready</h2>
<p>So you finally receive the email saying that your plugin is going to be uploaded with language pack support. Awesome! This is what the email that I received looks like. Note that I&#8217;m using one of my approved plugins as an example.</p>
<blockquote><p>Howdy!<br />
â€‹<br />
We&#8217;re emailing you because you&#8217;re an author for the following plugin on WordPress.org:<br />
â€‹<br />
* Easy Updates Manager : https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/<br />
â€‹<br />
Next week, we intend to import the plugin listed above into the translate.wordpress.org translation system. Language packs will also be enabled for your plugin, for any locales that are fully translated (at 100%).<br />
â€‹<br />
As part of this process, all of the strings in your plugin will be imported into translate.wordpress.org. Additionally, any language files that you ship with your plugin (&#8216;mo&#8217; files) will be imported and synced with their respective locales within translate.wordpress.org.<br />
â€‹<br />
No strings in your plugin? Plugin translations include the ability to translate the readme and display these translations in the localized WordPress.org plugin directories.</p>
<p>If you have prepared your plugin already then this notice is of no real importance. If you have not yet prepared your plugin and you have received the notice then you need to prepare your plugin ASAP. If you donâ€™t prepare your plugin thenâ€¦ wellâ€¦ I donâ€™t really know, but it wonâ€™t be good. So go and prepare your plugin if you have not yet done so.<br />
&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Your Plugin Is Semi-Ready for Language Packs. Now What?</h2>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-48741 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png?resize=291%2C321" alt="screenshot-22" /></a>A week or so after you receive the notice, your plugin and its translations are moved to <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org">translate.wordpress.org</a>. You will likely not receive a notice when your plugin is moved.</p>
<p>To find out if it&#8217;s been uploaded, visit your plugin&#8217;s WordPress.org page where you should see a translations section in the right sidebar. Click the <strong>Translate Plugin Name </strong>button<strong>.</strong> If you are brought to a page that looks like the one below then your plugin is uploaded and is ready to be translated.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48734" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png?resize=954%2C611" alt="screenshot-3" /></a>If you see a page that looks different from this (i.e., a Not Found error), your plugin is not yet ready.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve received the e-mail, your plugin is ready, and you&#8217;ve waited a reasonable amount of time, you should be good to go as far as preparing your plugin.</p>
<p>If it has been over two weeks and your plugin has not yet been uploaded, you should contact the Polyglot team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">on their blog</a>, or in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">#polyglots channel on WordPress Slack</a>. Please exercise extreme patience as the process can take a week or sometimes even two.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Removing Your Translation Files From Your Plugin</h2>
<p>Now that your plugin is uploaded to the system, you can safely remove the translation files from your plugin. If you donâ€™t have any <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files in your plugin, then you can skip this step.</p>
<p>One thing to note: You may not want to remove your translation files if your plugin does not have any translations on <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">translate.wordpress.org</a> or translations are not 100% complete.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Making Your Plugin Translatable</h2>
<p>With all of that stuff out-of-the-way, itâ€™s time to focus on translating your plugin. This is where it can get confusing but try to stick with me.</p>
<p>By default, you cannot submit translations for your plugin in any language. Because of this, you need to ask the Polyglots team to add you as a translator for your plugin. You can do so by heading over to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">Polyglots blog</a> and ask them. To make it easier they came up with a template of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/theme-plugin-directories/#sample-post">what to say</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Polyglots!</p>
<p>I am the plugin author for [plugin-name and link to plugin directory]. We have a number of great translation editors that weâ€™d like to be able to approve translation for our plugin(s). Please add the following WordPress.org users as translation editors for their respective locales:<br />
o #ar â€“ @username<br />
o #bn â€“ @username, @username<br />
o #da â€“ @username<br />
o #de-ch â€“ @username<br />
etcâ€¦</p>
<p>If you have any questions, just comment here. Thank you!</p></blockquote>
<p>Ideally, the above will include requests for multiple plugins, but as plugins are being rolled out slowly, it&#8217;s acceptable at the moment to include one request per plugin.</p>
<p>Make sure that you use WordPress.org usernames and that the user is still active. If you are wondering what languages there are, you can visit <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a> and scroll through the different languages that WordPress supports.</p>
<p>Please only ask to be added as a translator for the languages you know. You will not be approved if you are not a native speaker for a language.</p>
<p>At this point, again, patience is needed. The Polyglot team will receive your request and will work through it. If your post doesn&#8217;t show up right away, it&#8217;s because first-time posters are moderated.</p>
<p>In a week or two, the translators you requested should be added to your plugin. If there are any issues, a Polyglot member will comment on your request with any difficulties encountered or notify you that they have approved your request.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll know when you are added when you see new badges appear on your WordPress.org profile page. One is a translation editor badge and the other is a translation contributor badge.</p>
<h2><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48735" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png?resize=601%2C322" alt="screenshot-4" /></a>How Do I Translate?</h2>
<p>First, visit <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a>, select your language, then click the plugins tab. Search for your plugin and then click the translate project button. You&#8217;ll be brought to a page that looks like the one below. This page is where you can translate your plugin. In this case, my plugin is already translated in the language that I selected.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48736" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png?resize=957%2C587" alt="screenshot-5" /></a>On this table, there are four separate things to translate. Trunk, the stable release (version), and the <code>readme.txt</code> variations. In order for language packs to work, <em>you need to translate all four versions</em>.</p>
<p>To translate, click on one of the sub-projects. This takes you to the translation page. Here, you can see all of the different strings that need to be translated in your plugin. You can edit a string by clicking the details button, translating it in the text editor, and then clicking the <strong>add translations</strong> button.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48737" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png?resize=947%2C561" alt="screenshot-6" /></a>Even if you&#8217;re not added as an editor for a language, you can still translate a plugin. The only difference is instead of adding the translations directly, you can only request that it be changed. Someone from the Polyglots team will need review and approve your translation suggestions.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Once Your Translations Are Ready</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished translating a language completely, it will be available for people to use. However, it doesnâ€™t become available immediately. It can take one to three days for a translation to be available once you finish it. Again, exercise patience.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll know when the translation is available when you see it in the translation section on your WordPress.org plugin&#8217;s page. For example, you can see what it looks like in the picture below.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48744" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png?resize=447%2C377" alt="screenshot-7" /></a>Also, you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s working if you go into a website (preferably not a live website), download your plugin, and select the language that you want to test in <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="font-headlines">Plugin Language Packs Are Here to Stay</h2>
<p>Getting language packs to work properly in WordPress plugins is not exactly a straightforward process, which is precisely why plugins are being rolled out slowly.</p>
<p>Please remember that everyone is a volunteer, from the Polyglots team, to translators, and to the plugin authors. Please give props where appropriate as everyone is working hard to make plugin language packs the norm.</p>
<p>If you are having any trouble, the Polyglots team also has a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/">handbook</a> available which provides some good information on how this new system works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also do my best to answer any questions in the comment section. If you have additional insight, please weigh in as well.</p>

<p>In the presentation, Jaynes highlights the pros and cons of using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Testing plugin</a> on a testing site and a production site. However, he also cites a third way to test WordPress via <a href="http://wcpdx.trywpbeta.com/">TryWPBeta.com</a>.</p>
<p> 
<div> <strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture/trying-out-tomorrows-wordpress-today" title="Trying Out Tomorrowâ€™s WordPress Today" target="_blank">Trying Out Tomorrowâ€™s WordPress Today</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture" target="_blank">DrewAPicture</a></strong> </div>
<p>TryWPBeta is a locked down, vanilla install of WordPress trunk using Multisite. To login to the site, use the following credentials.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>
<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked Jaynes what inspired him to create the site, &#8220;The inspiration for TryWPBeta is to actually have a place for core contributors to test patches on mobile devices, because setting up a tunnel to a local development setup is difficult and a high barrier for a lot of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is to make it possible to spin up a site using trunk (Bleeding edge version of WordPress), apply a specific patch and then freeze it in time so that we can point people there to test on mobile devices,&#8221; Jaynes told the Tavern.</p>
<p>While you can&#8217;t install themes and plugins yet, the site gives users an opportunity to test new features without worrying about breaking the site. Thanks to TryWPBeta, I was able to test the new <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34903">Post oEmbed feature</a> in 4.4.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-48714" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png?resize=1025%2C458" alt="Testing oEmbeds of Posts" /></a>Testing oEmbeds of Posts
<p>Jaynes started the project at 10up&#8217;s company summit. So far, Scott Reilly, John Blackbourn, Zach Brown, Morgan Estes, and Chris Weigman have contributed to the project. The site is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet and updates hourly. He stresses that the site is a work in progress and not quite ready for prime time, &#8220;Thereâ€™s a couple features Iâ€™d like to add to make it more robust first,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://demo.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated demo site for users to test drive the software. While I like the idea behind TryWPBeta, there are a few things I&#8217;d like to see added to make it more useful. For instance, a list of items to test that users can check off. Also, an easy way to provide feedback on the listed items that is sent to a place where core developers will read it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to see the WordPress Beta Testing plugin extended to have the features I mentioned above. Between the communication challenges and setting up the environment, the beta testing process in WordPress is not as easy and streamlined as it could be. What ideas do you have that would help increase the testing audience and make the process easier?</p>

In July of 2014, VersionPress conducted a <a href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise $30K. However, the team raised only <strong>45% of the $30,000</strong> funding goal.</p>
<p>The team pressed on and released the first version back in January. Since then, the team has relied on funding from the <a href="http://versionpress.net/">Early Access Program</a>. Borek Bernard, the lead developer of VersionPress, says the influx of cash will help fuel rapid development:</p>
<blockquote><p>First and foremost, it means that we will be able to develop VersionPress at a more rapid pace. What we currently have in the <a href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/">recently released v2.0</a> is a great start but the vision and the technical challenge are just so large that this new fuel will is more than welcome. We have many cool features planned and this will allow us to deliver them in a timely manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of <a href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/">VersionPress 2.0</a> which includes, database synchronization functionality and an updated user interface that is completely JavaScript based, along with a number of other features. In addition to funding, Bernard says talking to investors gives him a fresh perspective on the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>One big benefit of talking to investors is that it provides a fresh perspective on the problems one is trying to solve, how to solve them, for whom, etc. Speaking to them made us realize a couple of important things which will greatlyÂ benefit our users down the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>VersionPress joins a growing list of WordPress products and services that have raised venture capital. In 2014, <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/coschedule-by-todaymade/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/coschedule-by-todaymade/">CoSchedule</a>, the editorial workflow and activity scheduling plugin, <a title="http://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-series-a-funding/" href="http://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-series-a-funding/">secured $500K</a> in a Series A round of funding. Prior to being acquired by Automattic, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-service-provider-bruteprotect-secures-funding-forms-parka-llc">BruteProtect secured a round of funding</a> from a private angel investor in California.</p>

Earlier this month, Williamson put the plugin up for sale and noted that it needed some development work.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I would like to sell my Frontend Registration and Login Forms plugin. <a href="https://t.co/HLGc8OVxq4">https://t.co/HLGc8OVxq4</a> &#8211; It needs some work. Interested? Ping me</p>
<p>&mdash; Pippinsplugins (@pippinsplugins) <a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins/status/651489362052431872">October 6, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The plugin was created in December of 2011, when Williamson <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/creating-custom-front-end-registration-and-login-forms/">published a tutorial</a> that explains how to create custom front end registration and login forms for WordPress. Although Vimal is participating in the commercial plugin space by selling a <a href="https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/slack/">Slack add-on for Ninja Forms</a>, this acquisition marks the first plugin sold directly from his site.</p>
<p>With the acquisition, <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/nikhil-vimal-adopts-front-end-registration-and-login-forms-plugin/">Williamson notes</a> that existing customers will no longer be able to renew license keys on <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com">Pippinsplugins.com</a>. A complete customer list was given to Vimal and Williamson is no long providing support.</p>
<p>When the opportunity presented itself to adopt a plugin created by Williamson, Vimal jumped on it, &#8220;Shortly after I saw his tweet, I quickly contacted Pippin. His work is something Iâ€™ve always looked up to. His work on plugins has inspired me to pursue the plugin/product market,&#8221; Vimal said.</p>
<p>Licenses start at $10 for single sites, $20 for two to five sites, and $35 for an unlimited number of sites. Vimal says that he is working on a new version with changes in design, functionality, and more. The plugin will also receive its own dedicated site with a change in branding.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what changes Vimal has in store for the plugin. Until then, existing customers from Pippinsplugins.com should watch their inbox for details on renewing their subscription to TechVoltz.com.</p>

With over <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/compare/4.3-branch...master">1,600 commits</a> since WordPress 4.3&#8217;s release, it&#8217;s important that 4.4 be tested by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Commits are bug fixes, additional functions or filters, new features, corrected typos, and anything inbetween. As a rule of thumb, think of commits as an incremental improvement to WordPress core.</p>
<p>There are three new distinct user facing features in WordPress 4.4.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twenty Sixteen</strong> &#8211; Twenty Sixteen is a <a href="http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme">new default theme</a> with a simple layout and color scheme designed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi">Takashi Irie,</a> who also designed the <a href="http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/">Twenty Fourteen</a> and <a href="http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/">Twenty Fifteen</a> default themes.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Images</strong> &#8211; WordPress will automatically deliver a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/responsive-images-merge-proposal/">more appropriate image</a> to users depending on a variety of conditions like screen size, view port size, and screen resolution.</li>
<li><strong>oEmbed Posts</strong> &#8211; In addition to YouTube, WordCamp.TV and other whitelisted providers, users will be able to easily embed content from almost any site that supports the <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed standard</a>, including <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">WordPress sites</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scott Taylor, who is leading the 4.4 development cycle, gives developers at least four reasons to be excited.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>â€”Â The underlyingÂ infrastructureÂ of the WordPress REST API <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">plugin</a> is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">included in WordPress 4.4</a>. Plugin authors can take advantage of this by adding custom endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Term Metadata </strong>â€” Taxonomy term metadata <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/04/taxonomy-term-metadata-proposal/">is included</a> in WordPress 4.4. Developers who are using a plugin to implement term metadata should <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">read this post</a> on how to prepare for the switch. Also, the underlying <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">WP_Term class</a> improves cachingÂ when working with terms.</li>
<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> â€” <code>wp_title()</code> is deprecated; WordPress will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>
<li><strong>CommentsÂ </strong>â€” Comment queries are now split for performance. Also, the underlyingÂ <code>WP_Comment</code> class improves caching and introducesÂ strong-typing. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8071">#8071</a>,Â <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32619">#32619</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Users are highly encouraged to test WordPress 4.4 and report bugs to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta section</a> of the support forums. Remember, the beta is software still in development and therefor not recommend for use on a production site. WordPress 4.4 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-4-project-schedule/">is scheduled</a> for release onÂ December 8th.</p>

While in Virginia Beach, I visited and worked from the <a href="http://www.rocketgenius.com/">Rocketgenius</a> office and observed how the team behind Gravity Forms works on a daily basis. In the show, I explain why I think the company&#8217;s setup is the best of both worlds for distributed workers.</p>
<p>We discuss what the future of WordPress may be like 10 years from now and whether or not it&#8217;s time for the XML-RPC protocol to be removed from WordPress. We end the show with the plugin picks of the week.</p>

With <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/35294">the change</a>, plugin authors will be able to check for theme support and use a few new filters to manipulate the title. The new filters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'pre_get_document_title'</code> short-circuits <code>wp_get_document_title()</code> if it returns anything other than an empty value.</li>
<li><code>'document_title_separator'</code> filters the separator between title parts.</li>
<li><code>'document_title_parts'</code> filters the parts that make up the document title, passed in an associative array.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theme authors should no longer use <code>wp_title()</code> to generate document titles. If theme authors add <code>add_theme_support( â€˜title-tagâ€™ );</code> to the <code>after_setup_theme</code> callback, the title will be handled natively via an internal WordPress core function. If you use a theme that utilizes wp_title and have <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG">wp_debug enabled</a> in WordPress 4.4, you&#8217;ll see a deprecation notice.</p>
<p>In general, users who upgrade to WordPress 4.4 won&#8217;t notice a difference. However, with nearly a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-4-project-schedule/">month to go</a> before WordPress 4.4 is released, theme developers are highly encouraged to check and update their themes accordingly.</p>

Ferreira organized and spoke at WordCamp SÃ£o Paulo in 2014 and designed the event&#8217;s website. She was the only woman to speak and volunteer at the event.</p>
<p>In 2015, Ferreira spoke at WordCamp Belo Horizonte&nbsp;on women working with WordPress in the Brazilian community. According to the post, Ferreira continues to play an active role encouraging women to get involved with WordPress and the technology field in Brazil:</p>
<blockquote><p>She has worked to debunk the myth that women have no interest in WordPress and web development. She has explored why women were not participating, speaking personally with many female programmers, designers and other WordPress professionals about this important topic. She regularly invites women to attend her local WordPress meetup, and works to ensure that they feel welcome and wanted when they do attend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only does Ferreira fulfill the <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship">scholarship&#8217;s requirements</a>, she&#8217;s the type of woman Kim Parsell would love to meet and talk to in person.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Jen Mylo, the WordPress foundation, and Matt Mullenweg for not only creating the scholarship, but for providing an opportunity for people like Ferreira to experience the largest annual WordPress conference first-hand.</p>

<hr />
<p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://www.littlebizzy.com/blog/disable-xml-rpc">announced</a> that all current and future domains hosted at <a href="https://www.littlebizzy.com" target="_blank">LittleBizzy</a> would have <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support" target="_blank">XML-RPC</a> permanently blocked due to the non-stop problems it was causing. In the announcement, we recommended that other WordPress users across the globe urgently consider blocking the technology on their own web servers as well.</p>
<h2>XML-RPC in WordPress Has a Troubled Past</h2>
<p>Days after the announcement<em>,</em> Daniel Cid, founder and CTO of Sucuri, and Mark Maunder, CEO of WordFence, <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2015/10/wordpress-xml-rpc-brute-force-attacks-amplification-multiple-logins/" target="_blank">reports</a> that a new type of Brute Force login attack was being carried out on a massive scale against WordPress sites around the world using XML-RPC. Apparently, hackers have wised up to the fact that <code>wp-login.php</code> is often well protected.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking than this latest wave of attacks is that <em>they are nothing new,</em> as Sucuri previously <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/new-brute-force-attacks-exploiting-xmlrpc-in-wordpress.html">reported a similar wave of attacks</a> in July 2014. Let&#8217;s also not forget the wide-scale use of XML-RPC to perform <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html">DDoS attacks</a> on WordPress websites <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/blog/wordpress-security-alert-pingback-ddos.html">reported by Incapsula</a> in 2013. Combine these reports with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awordpress.org%2Fsupport%2F+xml-rpc+attack">hundreds of posts</a> on the wordpress.org support forums and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Astackoverflow.com+xml-rpc+attack">Stack Overflow</a> and a picture is painted of years of unhindered attacks against millions of WordPress sites due to this single PHP file, yikes!</p>
<blockquote><p>It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. â€• Franklin D. Roosevelt</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be the one to advocate that XML-RPC be removed from WordPress but that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing: <strong>It&#8217;s time for WordPress XML-RPC to hit the road, for good.</strong></p>
<h2>XML-RPC Was a Conscious Mistake</h2>
<p>I understand that thousands of volunteer hours have been invested into XML-RPC support for the WordPress platform, as is the nature of open-source communities. I sincerely respect and thank said programmers and volunteers for creating a very cool way to remotely connect to a website built on WordPress. But sometimes, we need to be honest with ourselves and admit when something isn&#8217;t working; <em>This one of those times.</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I&#8217;m framing the XML-RPC mess as a conscious mistake, <strong>that&#8217;s because it was</strong>. Three years ago, Andrew Nacin, a WordPress core developer, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21509" target="_blank">announced</a> in a trac ticket that, <em>&#8220;Security is no greater a concern than the rest of core. There is no longer a compelling reason to disable [XML-RPC] by default. Itâ€™s time we should remove the option entirely.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Three years later, millions of WordPress sites have been hacked, crashed, or attacked, due to XML-RPC. Itâ€™s undeniable that removing the option to disable it (and/or enabling it by default) was wrong.</p>
<h2>Out of Touch With the Average User</h2>
<p>When broken down, it&#8217;s a classic case of extremely talented and intelligent software developers being out of touch with the millions of <strong>average Joes</strong> that use WordPress and have no idea what XML-RPC is. When developers inevitably argue that there are several free security plugins available that can help combat XML-RPC attacks, they completely miss the point: <u>the majority of webmasters being attacked are the same ones who don&#8217;t even know what a security plugin is or how to use it</u>.</p>
<p>Ironically, the one good <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bruteprotect/" target="_blank">standalone plugin</a> that fought Brute Force login attempts was <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect" target="_blank">foolishly</a> <a href="http://wptavern.com/jetpack-protect-blocks-brute-force-amplification-attacks" target="_blank">combined</a> into the controversial Jetpack plugin, which most serious webmasters would never consider installing.</p>
<p>The premise, of course, for XML-RPC support in WordPress is a noble idea that sounds versatile: it allows, as previously mentioned, remote connections (logins, usually) to any given domain that is running a WordPress installation. In reality, however, this XML-RPC functionality is primarily used for three common reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pingbacks/trackbacks (great for Viagra spam, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death" target="_blank">DDoS attacks</a>, and not much else)</li>
<li>Jetpack (an all-in-one solution to <a href="http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/" target="_blank">slowing down</a> and/or bloating your WordPress site with third-party scripts)</li>
<li>WP mobile apps (I&#8217;m not sure who blogs from their smart phone, but the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yo./id834335592" target="_blank">YO app</a> is literally rated higher than <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/wordpress/id335703880" target="_blank">WordPress</a> on the iTunes store, and the user reviews of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android" target="_blank">Android</a> version repeatedly point to XML-RPC login issues)</li>
</ol>
<p>Do recall that the WordPress backend is now responsive, which means you can login to your blog from practically any mobile device; this wasnâ€™t the case when the native WordPress mobile apps were first launched. And arguably, the vast majority of WordPress sites have absolutely no use for pingbacks, trackbacks, or XML-RPC in general.</p>
<h2>XML-RPC Needs to Be Disabled or Removed From WordPress</h2>
<p><u>The logical conclusion should be immediately clear:</u> XML-RPC needs to die a quick death in the WordPress community, or at least be shifted into an optional (non-default) plugin or otherwise, in order to bring an immediate and measurable improvement to the security and stability of not only WordPress sites, but the internet overall.</p>
<p>Perhaps Jeff Chandler <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks" target="_blank">said it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WP Tavern is no stranger to denial of service attacks due to pingbacks and trackbacks. In 2010, I explained how WP Tavern was trackbacked to death. Shortly after the website came back online, I disabled both as I feared they might end up taking the site down again. A few years have gone by and Iâ€™ve re-enabled pingbacks and trackbacks with no ill effects. However, I wonder if itâ€™s time to kill them once and for all, not just on WP Tavern but in WordPress in general.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, we as developers and others with a technical mindset get caught up in solving the challenge of the day, when what is really needed is to step back and take a more philosophical look at the bigger picture. Is this thing worth our time, or is it causing more problems than solutions? When it comes to XML-RPC in WordPress, the conclusion is obvious.</p>

I delight in a great reading experience, and I strongly believe typography is the key to creating a great reading experience.</p>
<p>In my own journeys searching for and choosing typefaces for my projects, I&#8217;ve discovered some great tools, and also some pitfalls of using different delivery services.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://typography.com">Typography.com</a> and <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a> accounts, and of course using <a href="http://google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> is very simple. Many folks also use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/">Myfonts</a>, generate their own on <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Fontsquirrel</a>, self-host direct from foundries, or use a variety of other methods.</p>
<p>When you use a font delivery service, where the font is hosted elsewhere, and you simply connect (like Typekit or Typography.com), one of the things you deal with is the authentication of your site with the service that can often cause sad delays in pageload times. Zach Tollman did a great post discussing how <a href="https://www.tollmanz.com/typography-coms-cssom-blocking-font-loader/">Typography.com in particular is not good at handling this authentication</a>, from a performance perspective.</p>
<p>Given that I host Post Status fonts on Typography.com &#8212; I use Gotham Round, Gotham Condensed, and Sentinel here, and none of them are available anywhere else &#8212; the hit on performance perturbs me. However, I love these fonts and hate to replace them. However, I&#8217;ve lately been doing some research so I can at least test font stacks from Typekit and Google to see how big of an impact it could have.</p>
<h3>FindingÂ Typefaces</h3>
<p>Finding quality typefacesÂ is a challenge. There are <em>so many</em> out there, and the differences in quality can be vast. Part of what I love about Typography.com is that the quality of the display and cross-browser rendering is outstanding. Typekit serves typefacesÂ from a variety of foundries, but they too have built great tools over the years to try and ensure quality rendering. Google is more of a mixed bag, though open source typefacesÂ are getting more attention to detail in recent years than ever before.</p>
<p>By far, my favorite tool for browsing and finding typefacesÂ is <a href="https://www.typewolf.com">Typewolf</a>. Typewolf has PDF guides (free with your email), trending typefaces, sites of the day, and high quality recommendations on when and where to use a particular typeface. A sample resource that&#8217;s outstanding is their list of the <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/open-source-web-fonts">top 30 open source Google fonts</a>. They have many others like that. It&#8217;s definitely a must-visit site when you are considering changing up your site typography.</p>
<p>You can also browse delivery services directly. Typekit&#8217;s <a href="https://typekit.com/lists">lists</a> are pretty good for narrowing typefaces by their intended purpose. <a href="http://justmytype.co/">Justmytype</a> is another great resource that shows recommended pairings for fonts from Typekit and Typography.com. And of course Google has filters in their directory to help narrow it down, but it&#8217;s still a bit of the wild west, so I usually rely on Googling good pairings for Google.</p>
<h3>Tinkering with typefaces with real content</h3>
<p>Once you find some Typefaces you like, then it&#8217;s fun to put them into practice. <a href="http://typecast.com/">Typecast</a> is excellent. You can find fonts from many foundries with a free account, and do all sorts of manipulations to see the typefaces in action, using a variety of font combinations, before you move to your actual site.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14749" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/typecast-view-752x462.png" alt="typecast-view" width="752" height="462" /></p>
<p>Beware, it&#8217;s easy to spend hours in this tool. I love that you can edit the CSS directly, and there are also tools within Typecast to insert particular types of content, so you can have a working prototype pretty quickly.</p>
<h3>Performance implications</h3>
<p>Loading fonts is a huge performance issue sometimes. Too many fonts, content blocking loading, time-outs from third party delivery services, and other gotchas can severely impact a site&#8217;s load times.</p>
<p>Anytime you are looking at new typefaces to use, consider where you can serve them from, whether you can self host them, how the delivery authenticates, and potentially more &#8212; before you get your heart set.</p>
<p>Some good rules of thumb are this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google is by far the fastest, but you just don&#8217;t have access to some of the greatest font foundries this way, because all Google fonts are free.</li>
<li>Self hosting is probably similar to or faster than serving them from Google. Most Google fonts are locally cached on lots of folks computers. Self hosting may be better for a more rare font, but for common fonts, Google may actually be faster.</li>
<li>System fonts are always the fastest, but you might not be able to deliver your preferred typeface if the system the reader is using doesn&#8217;t support the typeface. If using system typefaces, creating thorough font stacks is a necessity. Sometimes, especially for sans-serifs, I&#8217;m tempted to just declare sans-serif, so that the system serves its favorite font &#8212; as Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, et al each have their own defaults. For serifs, I&#8217;d say just use Georgia if using system fonts only <img src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
<li>Typekit and Myfonts and other delivery services are usually similar in quality, but it&#8217;s one of the slowest options for delivery. Be sure to only use the weights and versions you need, and considering limiting character sets if you can get away with it.</li>
<li>Have a performance budget for your type. Sometimes you have to make hard choices. Does your body font really need to be a non-system font? What if you just used a single display font to add the character you seek? Can you get away without italics for a certain typeface you&#8217;re using? What about bold? If you use the regular/bold/italic/bold-italic for every typeface, that adds up quickly. Use the bare minimum and add whenever you need to only.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don&#8217;t get too fancy, and consider your tone</h3>
<p>My biggest mistakes over the years playing with type have been getting too fancy, especially with body copy. Simple is good with type. Especially when choosing body copy, be sure to learn about the typeface you like &#8212; and don&#8217;t just trust your own eye early on &#8212; to see if it&#8217;s an appropriate workhorse typeface.</p>
<p>With display type, you have more leeway, but consider the mood that the typeface sets. Slabs, serifs, gothic, humanist, and other styles of type each tend to have their own tone that they set. For instance, when you read the New York Times, Georgia is a serious workhorse font, and the custom display font also sets a sober tone. Compared to Vox, for example, which uses a more casual sans-serif body copy and quite decorative display typeface. In both scenarios, readability is very good, but they set a different tone.</p>
<h3>Learning typography takes time</h3>
<p>Learning and understanding good typography practices takes time. Many factors are at play to make a typeface look great, and even the greatest typefaces can get screwed up when not used well.</p>
<p>Learning best practices for things like line length, line height, pairing, and much much more can probably get you farther than whatÂ typeface you choose. And different typefaces obviously do better in different settings. The key is to take it slow, learn what you like when you are reading other websites, and see what they are doing that you are not. Also, ask your friends about your choices and get feedback; sometimes just a minor change can make a big difference, and suddenly your design clicks.</p>
<p>We can easily be blind to our own typography mistakes. If you can limit mistakes and learn the essentials of choosing typefaces and using them well, your websites will look much, much better and your readers will be thankful, even if they never say it.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:23:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Due to the nature of the bug, the Akismet team pushed out auto updates to sites that can accept them. According <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/security-advisory-stored-xss-in-akismet-wordpress-plugin.html">to Sucuri</a>, sites using Akismet 3.1.4 and lower and that have the <strong><em>Convert emoticons like <img class="wp-smiley" src="https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" /> and <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" /> to graphics on display</em></strong> option enabled, are at risk.</p>
<p>The vulnerability stems from the way Akismet handles hyperlinks within a site&#8217;s comments. An attacker with sufficient knowledge of WordPress&#8217; internals could insert malicious scripts in the Comment section of the WordPress backend. This type of attack could lead to a number of other attacks, including compromising an entire site.</p>
<p>So far, Akismet developers <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2015/10/13/akismet-3-1-5-wordpress/">don&#8217;t have any evidence</a> that the vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild. Because the vulnerability is theoretically exploitable via comments, Akismet is blocking attempts during the comment-check API call so that sites not running the most recent version are protected. However, you should still upgrade immediately to 3.1.5.</p>

<p>One benefit of working from home that doesn&#8217;t get discussed much is the ease of small, but frequent exercise activities through the day. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not outlawed in an office to get out of your chair and do 20 jumping jacks, or plank for a minute, I definitely would feel awkward doing so. This is something on my mind as I&#8217;m working this week around ~400 colleagues for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/a8cgm">our once-a-year Grand Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m home and have a ton of work to get through, my favorite approach is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> with 25 minutes on followed by a 5 minute break. (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12">I use this app</a> but any timer will do.) The 5 minute break is a fantastic time to do something small, like a few push-ups, squats, a plank, or even meditate. (The new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pause-relaxation-at-your-fingertip/id991764216?mt=8">Pause app is cool</a>, and of course I <a href="http://calm.com/">love Calm</a>.) You don&#8217;t have to do a ton, but over the course of a day or a week these 5 minute break exercises add up to be quite a bit and can <a href="http://tinyhabits.com/">kickstart a Tiny Habit</a>. And don&#8217;t even get me started on the benefits of naps.</p>
<p>Again, not something that&#8217;s impossible in an shared office, just feels a lot more natural and less embarrassing in your private home office.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 18:37:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>A researcher from <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Sucuri</a> notified us of an XSS vulnerability in the Akismet WordPress plugin. This bug affects all versions of the Akismet WordPress plugin since 2.5.0, but we have no evidence that it has been exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve released updates for all vulnerable versions of the Akismet plugin. Additionally, the WordPress.org plugins team has enabled an <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/03/14/plugin-automatic-security-updates/">automatic update</a> for all sites running these vulnerable versions that are able to auto-update plugins.</p>
<p>Because the vulnerability is theoretically exploitable via comments, Akismet is already blocking attempts during the comment-check API call even if you are not running the most recent version. However, to be as safe as possible, you should still upgrade immediately.</p>
<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

Sucuri <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html">is reporting</a> that brute force amplification attacks are targeting WordPress sites with XML-RPC enabled. In a nutshell, XML-RPC contains a system.multicall method which allows developers to execute multiple methods and commands inside a single request.</p>
<h2>What is a Brute Force Amplification Attack?</h2>
<p>In a typical brute force attack, several machines or bots try to guess the username and password for a site oneÂ  at a time. In a brute force amplification attack, attackers can guess hundreds or thousands of combinations within a single request making the attack more efficient and difficult to block.</p>
<p>The XML-RPC protocol in WordPress is a communications bridge between remote applications such as the WordPress mobile apps and the site itself. It&#8217;s also used to communicate and authenticate to Jetpack.</p>
<h2>Jetpack Protect Does Its Job</h2>
<p>Jetpack comes with a module called <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/security-features/">Jetpack Protect</a> formerly <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect">known as BruteProtect</a>, that protects sites from brute force attacks. Sam Hotchkiss, lead developer of Jetpack Protect, <a href="https://samhotchkiss.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/testing-for-xml-rpc-multicall-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress/">confirms in a blog post</a> that Jetpack Protect blocks brute force amplification attacks out-of-the box.</p>
<blockquote><p>In our testing, we confirmed that Jetpack Protect (and BruteProtect) do block this attack vector. Â If youâ€™re running Jetpack with Protect enabled or youâ€™re running BruteProtect, you donâ€™t need to do anything to keep yourself safe from this attack technique.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you use Jetpack Protect, you don&#8217;t need to do anything to block this attack vector. For everyone else, Sucuri recommends that administrators block system.multicall requests as they&#8217;re not used much in the wild. There&#8217;s also a handful of security plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/">iThemes Security</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/">WordPress Simple Firewall</a> that block system.multicalls and can disable XML-RPC.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 18:24:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Oleg Belousov suggests <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/tv/2015/10/08/building-a-better-wordpress-tv-functional-requirements/comment-page-1/#comment-1483">WordPress.TV have a playlist feature</a> so viewers can favorite videos.

I&#8217;ve noticed that a lot of links to presentation slides point to the speaker&#8217;s personal site. To protect against link rot and expiring domains, WordPress.tv or a sister site should host presentation slides.</p>
<p>On the single post view for videos, you have to scroll down to read a video&#8217;s description in the right hand sidebar. Instead, I&#8217;d like to see WordPress.tv display information and related videos similar to YouTube since most of the relevant information is near the video itself.

<p>In his commit message, McCue referred to the infrastructure as a baby API:</p>
<blockquote><p>REST API: Introduce baby API to the world.</p>
<p>Baby API was born at 2.8KLOC on October 8th at 2:30 UTC. API has lots<br />
of growing to do, so wish it the best of luck.</p>

<p>In the lifespan of an open source project, there are milestone moments. Even though only half of the REST API is in WordPress 4.4, I consider this to be one of those moments.</p>
<p>If all goes well, developers will have access to the complete REST API in WordPress 4.5. I hope you&#8217;ll join me in congratulating all of the contributors that have and continue to work on the REST API.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Oct 2015 08:38:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"
